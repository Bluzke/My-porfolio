## React Developer Portfolio
## Description
This is a website built with React that serves as a personal portfolio for a web developer. The goal of the project is to showcase the developer's skills, project examples , and contact information in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The portfolio is designed to be dynamic and responsive, with smooth navigation between sections without reloading the page.

Why
The portfolio allows potential employers to quickly assess the developer's qualifications, experience, and coding ability. By viewing the developer’s real-world projects and interacting with a functional contact form, employers can easily evaluate whether the candidate is a good fit for an open position.

How
The app is built with React for creating dynamic user interfaces, React Router for in-page navigation, and CSS for styling. The sections of the portfolio are About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with each section containing the relevant information like a bio, project links, form validations, and downloadable resumes.
